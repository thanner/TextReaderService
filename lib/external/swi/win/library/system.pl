/** <module> System utilities

This module provides some tools to deal with system predicates. System
predicates cannot be traced or redefined.

@deprecated	Use :- set_prolog_flag(generate_debug_info, false) to
		hide predicate internals from the tracer.
*/

%%	system_mode(+OnOff)
%
%	Switch the system into system or user mode.  When in system mode,
%	system predicates loose most of their special properties, so it
%	becomes possible to trace and even redefine them.  Use the latter
%	with care as the system predicates call one another.  This should
%	once be fixed by defining all of them in a module ('$system'), so
%	the user can savely remove them from module user.

%%	system_module
%
%	Any predicate defined after this declaraction uptill the end of
%	the file will become a system predicate. Normally invoked by a
%	directive immediately following the module declaration.
