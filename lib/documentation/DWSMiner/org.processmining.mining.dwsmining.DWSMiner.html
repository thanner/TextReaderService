<p>The <b>plugin</b> is able to discover a set of workflow models that represent different subsets of the input log, and are arranged in a <b>browsable tree</b>.<BR>
<p> The mining is carried out through a top-down hierarchical clustering process, where the log is recursively split into homogeneous clusters (from a behavioral viewpoint).  All discovered clusters are then equipped with a specific workflow model (by exploiting algorithm HeuristicMining provided with ProM). <BR>
Any partitioning step hence produces a refinement of the workflow model being discovered. Specific behavioral patterns, named discriminant rules, are used as features for clustering log instances by means of classical k-means algorithm.</p>

<h3><font color="#000080"><b>Overview of the approach</b></font></h3>
<p>The discovery of a disjunctive schema WS for a given log, is carried out in 
an efficient way, through an iterative, hierarchical refinement of the process model. <BR>The basic idea is sketeched in the following figure. </p>

<p>The approach 
starts by mining a preliminary workflow schema W<sub>0</sub>, which is a first 
attempt to model the whole log. This schema, along with the log traces, 
corresponds to the root of a tree shown in the right side of the figure.<BR> 
Iteratively, one of the schemata that have not been refined yet (i.e., that 
correponds to some leaf of the tree) is refined: the set of traces that are 
associated with it are split into clusters, and a new schema is eventually mined 
for each of these clusters.<BR>By the way, any classical process mining technique 
could be exploited to mine any of the above workflow schemata, once homogeneous 
clusters of traces have been recognized.<BR>
At the end of the process, a disjunctive process model is obtained that 
consists of all the schemata at the leaves, and represents the log in a more 
accurate than W<sub>0</sub>.

<h3><font color="#000080"><b>How to cluster log traces</b></font></h3>

<p>In order to efficiently partition a set of traces into clusters by
        means of well-known
        methods, we resort to a “flat” relational
        representation of the traces, by projecting them onto a set of 
        features. <BR> Such features, called <i>discriminant rules</i>, are meant to characterize 
behavioral patterns which are not
        properly modelled by the current workflow schema being refined.<BR>In 
particular, a <i><font color="#FF0000">discriminant rule</font> </i>is

The figure 2 shows an example of 
      such rule for a workflow model handling the management of an order. The 
      rule simply capture the fact that a fidelity discount (task <i>m</i>) is 
      never applied when the registration of the (new) client has been performed 
      (task <i>e</i>).

<h3><font color="#000080"><b>Examples illustrating  the application of our&nbsp; process mining approach</b></font></h3>

<p>If you glad, you can download the log files for the example described below at the "example" section of the <I>www.workflowmining.org</I> web site (or directly from the example directory of PROM) and then experencing the usage of the DWS Mining plugin on these example scenarios.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><b><font color="#800000">Example 1</font></b></h4>
<p>A a first example, let us consider the process of handling customers’ orders within a business company,
for which the figure 2 &nbsp; shows a possible workflow schema. <BR>
We randomly generated a log (downloadable  at the URL: <I>www.workflowmining.org</I>) containing 5,000 traces, that
are all compliant with the workflow schema in <i>Figure 2</i>.<BR>
In addition, in the generation of the log, we also required that task <i>m </i>could not occur in
any execution trace containing <i>e</i>, and
that task <i>l </i>could not appear in any trace containing <i>d</i>. By the
way, these constraints assure that a fidelity discount is never applied to a new customer and that,
respectively, a fast dispatching procedure cannot be performed whenever some external supplies were asked for.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us now apply the DWS mining tool using the following values for its
parameters: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>sigma = </i>0.05 </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>gamma = </i>0.01</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">max. nr. of clusters per split = 4
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">max. lenght of features = 5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">max. nr. of splits = 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">max. nr. of features = 2</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result we obtain a tree with a root and four leaves. </p>
<p>The schema associated with the root is just the schema in <i>Figure 2</i>.
However, it is only a first attempt to model the whole log with a single schema.
Indeed, since it does not capture the constraints discussed above, it is not a
accurate enough model for the log. </p>
<p>The schemata of the leaves are instead reported in the following figure.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Figure3.jpg" width="436" height="161">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="Figure4.jpg" width="441" height="159"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Figure5.jpg" width="435" height="148">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="Figure6.jpg" width="435" height="170"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Figure 3</i></p>
<p>Each of the schemata in <i>Figure 3</i> models a different usage scenarios of
the process, and has been discovered by applying a classical process mining
algorithm to a properly discovered cluster of traces.</p>
<p>As a whole they constitute a disjunctive workflow schema that exactly model
the log,
and provides for a clearer view over the latent behavior of the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b><font color="#800000">Example 2</font></b></h4>
    <p>As a further example, let us consider the process of reviewing a paper submitted to a scientific conference. The process consists of
    the following tasks: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>rs</i></b>: receiving the submission</li>
  <li><i><b>sr<sub>i</sub></b></i>: sending the paper to the i-th reviewer</li>
  <li><b><i>rd</i></b>: receiving the revisions and take a decision</li>
  <li><i><b>d</b></i>: discussing on the
    paper in the case revisions are not uniform </li>
  <li><b><i>a</i></b>: accepting the paper</li>
  <li><b><i>r</i></b>: rejecting the paper </li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, in the case where the paper is authored
    by a program committee member, it has to be reviewed by 5 reviewers and it
    is immediately rejected in the case some reviewer does not want it to be
    accepted for publication. Otherwise, only 3 reviewers are assigned to the
    paper. </p>
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="Figure7.jpg" width="773" height="392"></p>
    <p align="center"><i>Figure 3</i></p>
    <p>A possible workflow schema for the process is reported on the left of
    Figure 3 — notice<br>
    e.g., that <b><i>rs </i></b>is an or-split. </p>
<p>According to this schema and to the above specified
    rules, we generated a log (downloadable  at the URL: <I>www.workflowmining.org</I>) of 5,000
    traces using a random generator. </p>
<p>We then applied the DWS mining tool using the same values as in the previous
example for all parameters, except for the nr. of clusters per split, that we
set to 2.</p>
<p>The two resulting schemas are
    shown on the right of the same figure. </p>
<p>It is clear that one schema
    models the process for papers
    written by a program committee member, while the other models any other case
— notice that for both schemas, <b><i>rs </i></b>is an and-join task, now.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b><font color="#800000">Example 3</font></b></h4>

<p>The examples above show that the approach is
very effective
in providing insights into a process whose enactment is constrained by some kind of rules, possibly involving information
that
is beyond
the pure execution of activities (e.g., stored in some database. This is quite a
common
situation in practical applications. <BR>However, even in the case where no behavioral rules are
defined and,
hence, where there is only one usage scenario, the approach is
still
useful in order to identify some (hidden) variants, which correspond to
anomalies and
malfunctioning in the system. In such a case, it is possible to recognize the
“normal” behavior of the process, along with the main groups of instances that deviate
from it.<br><BR>
As an example, we examine the results obtained with the log file <i>a12f5n20.xml</i>
(a real data set available at the URL: <I>www.processmining.org</I>),
when setting <i>sigma</i> = 0.01, <i>gamma</i> = 0.4, <i>feature#</i> = 3, <i>cluster#</i>= 3, and&nbsp; <i>featureLength</i> = 5. 
<p>Figure 4 shows the hierarchy and the models associated with each node in the
second level of it: one large cluster <i>R0</i> is discovered whose schema
coincides with that of <i>R</i> and then represents the typical behavior. <BR>Conversely, both clusters <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i> (containing 17 and 37 traces, respectively) may be perceived as outliers w.r.t. the
discovered main behavior.</p>
