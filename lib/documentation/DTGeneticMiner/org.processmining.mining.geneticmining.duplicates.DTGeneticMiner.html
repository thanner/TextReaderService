The 

&quot;Duplicate Tasks GA plug-in&quot; is suitable to mine process models with 
duplicate tasks. Duplicate tasks occur when more than one task in a process 
model can have the same label. As the &quot;Genetic Algorithm plug-in&quot;, the &quot;Duplicate 
Tasks GA plug-in&quot; also uses genetic algorithms to mine process models from 
event logs. Its output is a set of process models that are <i>decreasingly</i> 
ordered by the fitness value. In other words, the best mined model is listed 
first, and so on. Genetic algorithms are adaptive search methods that try to mimic the process of evolution. These algorithms start with an 
<i>initial population</i> of individuals. Every individual is assigned a <i>fitness</i> measure to indicate its quality. In our case, an individual is a possible process model and the fitness is a function that evaluates how well the individual is able to reproduce the behavior in the log. 
Populations evolve by <i>selecting</i> the fittest individuals and 
generating new individuals using <i>genetic operators</i> such as <i>crossover</i> (combining parts of two or more individuals) 
and <i>mutation</i> (random modification of an individual).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every individual in the population is represented as a <i>causal matrix</i> (called Heuristic Net in ProM). 
Figure 3 illustrates the causal matrix for the process model in Figure 2. The 
causal matrix shows the dependencies between the tasks, as well as the semantics 
of these dependencies. In short, every tasks has an input (I) and output (O) set 
of dependencies. Tasks in a same subset of an input/output set have an 
XOR-relation. Tasks in different input/output subsets of a task have an 
AND-relation.</p>

<p>The &quot;Duplicate Tasks GA plug-in&quot; parameters are:</p>


<p><b>Population size</b><br><br>
 Sets the number of individuals that are going to be used during the search.</p>


<p><b>Initial population type</b><br><br>
Sets how the initial population should be built. The table below summarizes 
the possible options.<p>&nbsp;</p>

    </tr>
</table>

<p><b>Maximum number of generations</b><br><br>

Sets the maximum number <i>n</i> of times that the genetic algorithm can iterate. This parameter 
relates to the stopping criteria. In short, the Duplicate Tasks GA Plug-in stops when (i) 
it finds an individual whose fitness is maximal, (ii) it iterates <i>n</i> times, or 
(iii) the fittest individual has not changed for <i>n</i>/2 iterations in a row.
</p>




<p><b>Seed</b><br><br>
Sets the seed that is used to generate random numbers for this plug-in.
</p>


<p><b>Power Value</b><br><br>

Sets the power value that is used by the heuristics to set the dependencies 
between the tasks in every individual in the initial population.
In a nutshell, the heuristics works as follows: the more often a task <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> is directly followed by a 
task <i>t<sub>2 </sub></i> (i.e. the subtrace <i>&quot;t<sub>1</sub>t<sub>2</sub>&quot;</i> appears in traces in the log), the higher the probability 
that individuals are built with a dependency (or arc) from <i>t<sub>1 </sub></i> to <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>.
The power value is used to control the "influence&quot; of the heuristics in the probability of setting a 
dependency between two tasks. Higher values for power value lead to the inferring of fewer 
dependencies between two tasks in the event log, and vice-versa. 
</p>

<p><b>Elistism rate</b><br><br>

Sets the percentage of the fittest individuals in the current generation that are going to be copied to the next generation. 
For instance, an elitism rate of 0.02 means that 2% of the best individuals in 
the population are copied to the next population.

</p>


<p><b>Fitness Type</b><br><br>

Sets the type of the fitness that the Duplicate Tasks GA plug-in uses to assess the quality of an individual. 
The quality of an individual is basically set by its replaying of the log traces. 
This replay can use a stop semantics parser or a continous semantics one. The 
stop semantics parser stops whenever the task to be parsed is not enabled. The 
continuous semantics parser works in a different way: whenever a task is not 
enabled, the problem is registered (for instance, the number of missing tokens), 
and the task is fired. The fitness type <i>Proper Completion </i>uses stop semantics parser. The other fitness types use a 
continuous semantics one. In short, the fitness types work as follows:</p>

    The parameter <i>kappa</i> and <i>gamma</i> of the fitness <i>ExtraBehaviorPunishment</i>
    respectively corresponds to the advanced fitness parameters "Extra Behavior Punishment" and
    "Duplicates With Common In/Out Tasks Punishment".</caption>
</table>



<p><i>NOTE: We strongly recommend the use of the &quot;ExtraBehavior&quot; fitness 
type because it incorporates the concepts of the other fitness types.</i></p>


<p><b>Show Advanced Fitness Parameters</b><br><br>

Allows for the setting of the parameters for the selected fitness type. For the DGA, the fitness "ExtraBehaviorPunishment" 
is the only one to have parameters. These parameter are the&nbsp; <i>Extra Behavior 
Punishment </i>(the <i>kappa</i> in item 5 of Figure 4) and the <i>Duplicates With Common In/Out Tasks Punishment&nbsp;
</i>(the <i>gamma</i> in item 5 of Figure 4).
</p>



<p><b>Use Genetic Operators</b><br><br>
Sets if the genetic operators crossover and mutation are going to be used to build the 
populations that follow the initial population. If this option is unchecked, the next&nbsp;
populations are built just like the initial population. If this option is checked, 
then the individuals of the next population that do not belong to the elite are 
created by applying crossover and mutation to individuals in the current 
population. The cycle works are follows: first two parents are selected; second they undergo
 crossover (with a certain probability) and produce two offsprings; third, every offspring may be
 mutated with a certain probability; finally, the offsprings are inserted into the new population.
</p>


<p><b>Selection Method Type</b><br><br>
Sets how the parents for genetic operators are going to be chosen. Both methods are based on a tournament. The <i>Tournament </i>
&nbsp;type works by randomly selecting <i>two</i> individuals in the population and returning the fittest individual in 75% of the times,
 and the less fit individual in 25% of the times. The <i>Tournament5</i> type 
randomly selects <i>five</i> individuals in the population and always returns 
the fittest individual.</p>

<p><b>Crossover Type</b><br><br>
Sets how two parents (selected individuals) are going to be recombined. There 
are two possible types: <i>Enhanced</i> and <i>Duplicates Enhanced</i>. The 
Enhanced type works at the <i>task level</i>. 
The Duplicates Enhanced works at the <i>duplicate level. </i>In short, the crossover types work as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><i>Enhanced</i>: swaps subsets in the input/output set of a same task 
    identifier. With equal probability,
the swapped subsets can be: (i)  included into the input/output set, (ii) merged with some&nbsp;
unswapped subsets in the input/output sets, or (iii) add the swapped sets and remove from some&nbsp;
unswapped subsets intersecting elements that are in the swapped ones.</li>
    <li><i>Duplicates Enhanced</i>: Similar to the type &quot;Enhanced&quot;, but this 
    crossover type works at the duplicate level. This means that two different 
    task identifiers can be mapped to the same label. </li>
</ol>
<p><i>NOTE: We strongly recommend the use of the &quot;Duplicates Enhanced&quot; crossover 
type because it allows the interchange of causality relations between tasks that 
refer to the same label. I.e., between duplicate tasks.</i></p>


<p><b>Crossover Rate</b><br><br>Sets the probability that two parents are 
going to be recombined to create two offsprings for the next generation. If the 
probability is equal to 0, then, after the crossover, the offsprings are just 
like the parents.</p>


<p><b>Mutation Type</b><br><br>
Sets how an individual is going to be randomly modified. The mutation point is 
a task.</p>
<ol>
    <li><i>Enhanced</i>: performs one of the following operations with equal 
    probability: (i) add a task to a subset in the input/output set of the 
    mutated task, (ii) remove a task from a subset in the input/output set of a 
    mutated task, or (iii) re-arrange the subsets of the input/output set of the 
    mutated task.</li>
</ol>


<p><b>Mutation Rate</b><br><br>

Sets the probability that an individual is going to be mutated.</p>
