Only write the body of a HTML document, 
so without the <html>, <head> and <body> tags. 

Each subfolder should have the exact name as the class, but without the package.
Within each subfolder there should be a file with the exact name as the class,
including the package, ending with ".html"

File in that folder:  org.processmining.analysis.conformance.ConformanceAnalysisPlugin.html
