The 

&quot;Genetic Algorithm plug-in&quot; uses genetic algorithms to mine process models from 
event logs. Its output is a set of process models that are <i>decreasingly</i> 
ordered by the fitness value. In other words, the best mined model is listed 
first, and so on. Genetic algorithms are adaptive search methods that try to mimic the process of evolution. These algorithms start with an 
<i>initial population</i> of individuals. Every individual is assigned a <i>fitness</i> measure to indicate its quality. In our case, an individual is a possible process model and the fitness is a function that evaluates how well the individual is able to reproduce the behavior in the log. 
Populations evolve by <i>selecting</i> the fittest individuals and 
generating new individuals using <i>genetic operators</i> such as <i>crossover</i> (combining parts of two or more individuals) 
and <i>mutation</i> (random modification of an individual).

<p>Every individual in the population is represented as a <i>causal matrix</i>. 
Figure 3 illustrates the causal matrix for the process model in Figure 2. The 
causal matrix shows the dependencies between the tasks, as well as the semantics 
of these dependencies. In short, every tasks has an input (I) and output (O) set 
of dependencies. Tasks in a same subset of an input/output set have an 
XOR-relation. Tasks in different input/output subsets of a task have an 
AND-relation.</p>

<p>The &quot;Genetic Algorithm plug-in&quot; parameters are:</p>


<p><b>Population size</b><br><br>
 Sets the number of individuals that are going to be used during the search.</p>


<p><b>Initial population type</b><br><br>
Sets how the initial population should be built. The table below summarizes 
the possible options.<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Maximum number of generations</b><br><br>

Sets the maximum number <i>n</i> of times that the genetic algorithm can iterate. This parameter 
relates to the stopping criteria. In short, the Genetic Algorithm Plug-in stops when (i) 
it finds an individual whose fitness is maximal, (ii) it iterates <i>n</i> times, or 
(iii) the fittest individual has not changed for <i>n</i>/2 iterations in a row.
</p>




<p><b>Seed</b><br><br>
Sets the seed that is used to generate random number for this plug-in.
</p>


<p><b>Power Value</b><br><br>

Sets the power value that is used by the heuristics to build the initial population.
In a nutshell, the heuristics works as follows: the more often a task <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> is directly followed by a 
task <i>t<sub>2 </sub></i> (i.e. the subtrace <i>&quot;t<sub>1</sub>t<sub>2</sub>&quot;</i> appears in traces in the log), the higher the probability 
that individuals are built with a dependency (or arc) from <i>t<sub>1 </sub></i> to <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>.
The power value is used to control the "influence&quot; of the heuristics in the probability of setting a 
dependency between two tasks. Higher values for power value lead to the inferring of fewer 
dependencies between two tasks in the event log, and vice-versa. 
</p>

<p><b>Elistism rate</b><br><br>

Sets the percentage of the fittest individuals in the current generation that are going to be copied to the next generation. 
For instance, an elitism rate of 0.02 means that 2% of the best individuals in 
the population are copied to the next population.

</p>


<p><b>Fitness Type</b><br><br>

Sets the type of the fitness that the Genetic Algorithm plug-in uses to assess the quality of an individual. 
The quality of an individual is basically set by its replaying of the log traces. 
This replay can use a stop semantics parsing or a continuous semantics one. The 
<i>stop semantics parsing</i> stops whenever the task to be parsed is not enabled. The 
<i>continuous semantics parsing</i> works in a different way: whenever a task is not 
enabled, the problem is registered (for instance, the number of missing tokens), 
and the task is fired anyway. The fitness types <i>Proper Completion</i> and <i>Stop 
Semantics</i> use stop semantics parsing. The other fitness types use a 
continuous semantics one. In short, the fitness types work as follows:</p>

<p><i>NOTE: We strongly recommend the use of the &quot;ExtraBehaviorPunishment&quot; fitness 
type because it incorporates the concepts of the other fitness types.</i></p>

<p><b>Show Advanced Fitness Parameters</b><br><br>

Allows for the setting of the parameters for the selected fitness type. For the GA, the fitness "ExtraBehaviorPunishment" 
is the only one to have a parameter. This parameter is the <i>Extra Behavior 
Punishment </i>(the <i>kappa</i> in item 5 of Figure 4).
</p>


<p><b>Use Genetic Operators</b><br><br>
Sets if the genetic operators crossover and mutation are going to be used to build the 
populations that follow the initial population. If this option is unchecked, the next populations are built just like the initial population. If this option is checked, 
then the individuals of the next population that do not belong to the elite are 
created by applying crossover and mutation to individuals in the current 
population. The cycle works are follows: first two parents are selected;second they undergo
 crossover (with a certain probability) and produce two offsprings; third, every offspring may be
 mutated with a certain probability; finally, the offsprings are inserted into the new population.
</p>


<p><b>Selection Method Type</b><br><br>
Sets how the parents for genetic operators are going to be chosen. Both methods are based on a tournament. The 
method type <i>Tournament</i>&nbsp; works by randomly selecting <i>two</i> individuals in the population and returning the fittest individual in 75% of the times,
 and the less fit individual in 25% of the times. The method type <i>Tournament5</i>&nbsp; randomly selects <i>five</i> individuals in the population and always returns 
the fittest individual.</p>

<p><b>Crossover Type</b><br><br>
Sets how two parents (selected individuals) are going to be recombined. All types work at the task level. 
However, their granularity varies. A task has an input and output set. 
So, some crossover types work on the full input/output sets, others on subsets 
that are in the input/output sets of a task. In short, the crossover types work as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><i>Local One Point</i>:  always swaps both the input and output sets of a task.</li>
<li><i>Variable Local One Point</i>: swaps both input/output sets in 50% of the 
times. The other times only one of these sets is swapped.</li>
    <li><i>Fine Granularity</i>: swaps subsets in the input/output set of a 
    task. If the subsets that are been swapped have intersecting elements with subsets
    (in the other individual) that were not swapped, this crossover type randomly chooses 
    if these subsets (the swapped and unswapped ones) are going (i) to be merged,  
    or (ii) if the common elements are  going to be removed from the subsets 
    that were not swapped during the crossover.</li>
<li><i>Enhanced</i>: swaps subsets in the input/output set of a task. With equal probability,
the swapped subsets can be: (i)  included into the input/output set, (ii) merged with some&nbsp;
unswapped subsets in the input/output sets, or (iii) add the swapped sets and remove from some&nbsp;
unswapped subsets intersecting elements that are in the swapped ones.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>NOTE: We strongly recommend the use of the &quot;Enhanced&quot; crossover 
type because it incorporates the concepts of the other crossover types.</i></p>


<p><b>Crossover Rate</b><br><br>Sets the probability that two parents are 
going to be recombined to create two offsprings for the next generation. If the 
probability is equal to 0, then, after the crossover, the offsprings are just 
like the parents.</p>


<p><b>Mutation Type</b><br><br>
Sets how an individual is going to be randomly modified. The mutation point is 
a task.</p>
<ol>
    <li><i>All Elements</i>: adds or removes one element of a subset in the 
    input/output set of the mutated task.</li>
    <li><i>Partition Redefinition</i>: re-arranges the subsets of the 
    input/output set of the mutated task.</li>
    <li><i>Enhanced</i>: performs one of the following operations with equal 
    probability: (i) add a task to a subset in the input/output set of the 
    mutated task, (ii) remove a task from a subset in the input/output set of a 
    mutated task, or (iii) re-arrange the subsets of the input/output set of the 
    mutated task.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>NOTE: We strongly recommend the use of the &quot;Enhanced&quot; mutation 
type because it incorporates the concepts of the other mutation types.</i></p>


<p><b>Mutation Rate</b><br><br>

Sets the probability that an individual is going to be mutated.</p>
