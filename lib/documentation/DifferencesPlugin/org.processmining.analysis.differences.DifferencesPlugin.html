<p>The differences analysis plugin allows you to discover and diagnose 
differences between two business processes either in the Petri net or in the EPC 
notation.</p>

<h1>Overview of the Approach</h1>
<p>The plugin takes two processes as input and decides whether they are 
different. (We say that two processes are different if they are not completed 
trace equivalent.) If the processes are different, the plugin points out exactly 
where they are different and why they are different. This in contrast to 
techniques that provide simple true/false answers about whether two processes 
are different or not. The feedback on why processes are different is given in 
terms of frequently occurring differences that we discovered in practice. The 
plugin can be used for various purposes, such as detecting differences between 
processes in a merger between organizations.</p>
<h1>Using the Plugin</h1>
<p>The following procedure shows you how to use the plug-in:</p>
<ol>
	<li>open the processes that you want to compare, for this example use
	<a href="componentnet1.pnml">componentnet1.pnml</a> and
	<a href="componentnet2.pnml">componentnet2.pnml</a>;</li>
	<li>open this plugin, use the two processes that you just opened as 
	arguments;</li>
	<li>now indicate which tasks in one process are equivalent to which tasks in 
	the other process, for this example tasks with identical names are 
	considered to be equivalent, if you click 'find match' the plugin will 
	automatically find a match between tasks based on their labels;</li>
	<li>click 'evaluate' and the plugin will identify and diagnose the 
	differences.</li>
</ol>
